# Systematic Investment Analysis Framework

**April 2025 - Present**

## Overview

A configuration-driven, objective approach to investment analysis that eliminates conversational bias and provides consistent, reproducible results. This framework applies systematic methodology to stock screening and valuation, combining traditional financial models with machine learning predictions.

The system processes entire market indices (S&P 500) through a comprehensive 5-step analysis pipeline: Quality → Value → Growth → Risk → Valuation, providing investors with disciplined, objective stock analysis.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Predictions** - LSTM/Transformer neural network with 78.64% directional accuracy
- **Systematic Methodology** - Identical analysis steps for every stock, eliminating human bias
- **Static HTML Dashboard** - Fast, clean interface with real-time valuations
- **Configurable Analysis** - Define investment criteria via YAML configuration files
- **Multiple Valuation Models** - DCF, Enhanced DCF, Growth DCF, RIM, Simple Ratios
- **Comprehensive Screening** - Quality, value, growth, and risk dimensions
- **Scalable** - Analyze individual stocks or entire market indices
