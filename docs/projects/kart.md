!!! success "Status — May 2026"
    ROS 2 migration complete. Manual mode fully operational. **First
    autonomous run completed 5 full laps on a cone-defined track**
    (April 2025) before a printed PLA sun gear in the steering reducer
    snapped on the 6th lap — a known PLA-creep failure with a brass
    upgrade already designed. Autonomous mode actively integrated.

## What it is

A modular autonomous platform built on a real Tony Kart chassis, designed as an **outdoor testbed** for perception, planning, and control algorithms. Maintains manual drive capability so a safety driver can take over at any time, which makes it a practical platform for real-world algorithm validation rather than a simulator-bound demo.

## Hardware

- **Compute** — NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin (JetPack 6.2.2, CUDA 12.6, 62 GB RAM, Ubuntu 22.04)
- **Perception sensor** — ZED 2 stereo camera (USB 3.0, GPU-accelerated depth)
- **Microcontroller** — ESP32 "Kart Medulla" custom PCB, FreeRTOS, UART link to the Orin at 115200 baud
- **Steering actuation** — DC motor + planetary reducer (in-house design)
- **Emergency brake** — fail-safe pneumatic system on STM32
- **Wheel sensorisation** — custom PCB for hall-effect odometry
- **Frame** — 2024 Tony Kart competition chassis
- **Power** — custom 18650 lithium pack with JBD BMS, spot-welded in-house

## Software architecture

Everything from cone perception to steering commands runs in **ROS 2 Humble** on the Orin. The ESP32 is the safety boundary: if the high-level loop dies, the kart fails into a known mechanical-safe state independent of the Linux side.

- **Perception** — YOLOv5 cone detector + stereo depth localiser. 3D cone positions published to ROS 2 in real time on the Jetson's GPU.
- **Control** — geometric / pure-pursuit controllers. Each controller publishes its picked target point to `/kart/target`; the dashboard HUD subscribes to the same topic, so what the user sees and what the controller commands cannot disagree.
- **Pre-ROS legacy stack** — earlier 100% Python pipeline ran at ~50 Hz end-to-end on the same hardware. [Walkthrough video](https://youtu.be/wZSFr2eYE4M?si=JckY54OkSBQb4r1M).
