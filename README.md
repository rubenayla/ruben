# ruben — personal site

**Live site: <https://rubenayla.xyz/>**

Personal site / hub built with MkDocs Material — portfolio, writing, standards, references, ideas, and CV, all in one place. Three main sections:

1. **Homepage (`docs/index.md`)** — CV-style landing: who I am, what I work on, and direct links to LinkedIn, GitHub, and the resume PDFs (EN + ES). This is what someone lands on from a job application or LinkedIn click — it should answer "who is this person, and where do I find their CV?" in one screen.
2. **Project tabs** — one tab per substantial project (driverless kart, Partle, Cyberwheel, investment analysis, …). Each is a self-contained write-up under `docs/projects/` or its own folder (e.g. `docs/build-journey/`).
3. **Writing tab** — essays and (eventually) standards / opinionated conventions. Lives under `docs/writing/`. Same status as a project tab: a section of the site, not a sub-page of something else. Subdivides into `essays/` and `standards/` as it grows.

Top-level nav tabs are defined in `mkdocs.yml` under `nav:`.

## Local Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rubenayla/ruben.git
cd ruben
uv sync
uv run mkdocs serve
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Deployment

Auto-deploys to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions on push to `main`. The custom domain (`rubenayla.xyz`) is wired through `docs/CNAME`.

### Setup GitHub Pages

1. Repository Settings → Pages
2. Build and deployment source: "GitHub Actions"
3. Push to `main` to trigger

```

```

## Adding Content

### A new project tab

1. Create `docs/projects/<name>.md`
2. Add it under `nav:` in `mkdocs.yml`
3. Optionally feature it on the homepage (`docs/index.md`)

### A new essay or standard

1. Create `docs/writing/<topic>.md` (or a folder if it's multi-page)
2. Add it under the `Writing:` section in `nav:` in `mkdocs.yml`, nested under `Essays:` or `Standards:` depending on the shape

### Images

Place in `docs/images/` and reference relatively:
